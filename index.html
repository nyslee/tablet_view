If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping. <br><br> Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.</p>

He doesn’t like water (showers and even rain) or getting his nails clipped, and he’s sometimes even so lazy that he’ll just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go back home.</p>
